//Event Loop

// => The Node.js event loop is responsible for handling all the asynchronous code execution in the application.
//It uses a mechanism called "callbacks" to handle the events and execute the code associated with them.
//When a callback is called, it is added to the event loop queue, and the event loop will execute it when it reaches the callback in the queue.
